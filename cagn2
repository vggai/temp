### Slide Title: Dynamic Badge Color and Level Update Using Skill Scores and CGAN

**Introduction**:
- This patent idea revolves around dynamically updating user badges based on their skill scores derived from conversations.
- If a skill score change is not sufficient to cross a level, the badge's most prominent feature's color is altered.
- If the score crosses a level threshold, a new badge is assigned, and a base color is generated using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN).

**Skill Score Update**:
- The updated skill score for two users in conversation is calculated as:
  \( S' = S + w_s \cdot dQ \)
  - \( S' \): Updated skill score
  - \( S \): Current skill score
  - \( w_s \): Learnable parameter
  - \( dQ \): Change in skill score during conversation

**Badge Update Logic**:
- **Minor Score Changes**:
  - If the change in skill score is minor and doesn't cross a level, only the color of the badge's most prominent feature is altered.
- **Level Threshold Crossing**:
  - If the skill score crosses a level threshold, a new badge is assigned.
  - A base color for the new badge is generated using CGAN.

**Prominent Feature Detection**:
- Detect the most prominent feature of the badge to apply color changes.
- Example: In a camera icon badge, the ring around the lens could be considered the most prominent feature.

**CGAN Integration**:
- Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) are used to generate new colors for the most prominent feature of the badge.
- CGAN ensures the generated colors are distinct and visually appealing.

**Flow Chart Diagram**:
- **Conversation Analysis**:
  - Monitor user conversations and extract skill scores.
- **Score Update**:
  - Calculate the updated skill score \( S' = S + w_s \cdot dQ \).
- **Determine Badge Update**:
  - Check if the updated score crosses a level threshold.
- **Prominent Feature Detection**:
  - Identify the most prominent feature of the badge.
- **Color Generation using CGAN**:
  - Use CGAN to generate a new color for the prominent feature.
- **Badge Update**:
  - Apply the new color to the prominent feature or assign a new badge if the level threshold is crossed.
