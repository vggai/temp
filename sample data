To provide a more comprehensive view of how data is structured for machine learning in an application like Tesla's Autopilot, we can expand the previous examples. This includes a more detailed look at how data from multiple sensors might be integrated and how additional details can provide deeper insights for model training. 

### Expanded Camera Feed Data

Let's assume the camera system captures more than just the visual scene; it might also tag each frame with metadata such as camera ID and environmental conditions.

| Timestamp           | Frame_ID | Camera_ID | Description                   | Environmental_Conditions | File_Path       |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| 2024-02-15 08:00:00 | 1        | Front     | Vehicle approaches stop sign  | Sunny, Dry Road          | frame_00001.jpg |
| 2024-02-15 08:00:01 | 2        | Front     | Vehicle stops at stop sign    | Sunny, Dry Road          | frame_00002.jpg |

### Expanded Radar Sensor Data

Radar data can also include additional detail, such as the type of object detected and its acceleration, offering richer context for understanding vehicle surroundings.

| Timestamp           | Object_ID | Distance_m | Velocity_m/s | Acceleration_m/s2 | Object_Type | Angle_degrees |
|---------------------|-----------|------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-02-15 08:00:00 | 1         | 50         | -2           | 0                 | Car         | 0             |
| 2024-02-15 08:00:01 | 2         | 48         | 0            | 0                 | Car         | 0             |

### Expanded Ultrasonic Sensor Data

Ultrasonic sensors, apart from distance, might also record the type of surface or object they detect, providing a more nuanced view of immediate vehicle surroundings.

| Timestamp           | Sensor_ID    | Distance_cm | Object_Detected |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 2024-02-15 08:00:00 | Front_Center | 200         | Curb            |
| 2024-02-15 08:00:01 | Front_Center | 150         | Curb            |

### Expanded GPS and Map Data

GPS data might be enriched with vehicle speed and heading, offering insights into how the vehicle navigates through its environment.

| Timestamp           | Latitude  | Longitude   | Speed_km/h | Heading | Location_Description    |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------|------------|---------|-------------------------|
| 2024-02-15 08:00:00 | 37.421999 | -122.084057 | 30         | North   | Approaching stop sign   |
| 2024-02-15 08:00:01 | 37.422000 | -122.084058 | 0          | North   | At stop sign            |

### Integrating Data for Machine Learning

In practice, machine learning models for autonomous driving are trained on integrated datasets that combine information from all these sources. For example, to train a model to recognize stop signs:

- **Input:** A synchronized dataset combining camera images showing the stop sign, radar data indicating nearby vehicle distances, ultrasonic sensor readings of the curb as the car stops, and GPS/map data marking the stop sign's location.
- **Label:** For supervised learning, each input is labeled with the correct action (e.g., "stop at the stop sign"), which the model learns to predict.

This comprehensive approach ensures that the model has a rich dataset from which to learn, encompassing not just visual cues but also spatial, navigational, and environmental context. This complexity is necessary to train a system like Autopilot to make safe and informed decisions in a wide range of driving conditions.
