We aim to develop a solution that leverages AI to identify real-world locations depicted in movies and provide users with an immersive viewing experience of these locations through Google Earth on TV or VR headsets. This system will enhance user engagement by enabling a seamless transition from watching a movie to exploring its filming locations virtually, enriching the overall entertainment experience and fostering a deeper connection with the content.
