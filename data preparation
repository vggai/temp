In the data preparation step, data from the various sources outlined in the previous tables is cleaned, transformed, and integrated to form a comprehensive dataset that can be used to train machine learning models. This process involves several key steps such as normalization, feature engineering, and augmentation. Here's how the prepared data might look after these steps, focusing on integrating and structuring it for a machine learning model:

### Integrated and Prepared Data Example

For simplicity, let's consider preparing data for a model that predicts necessary vehicle actions based on sensor inputs and environmental conditions. The table below represents a simplified view of how the prepared data might look, integrating information from camera feeds, radar, ultrasonic sensors, and GPS/map data into a structured format suitable for training:

| Timestamp           | Camera_ID | Radar_Distance_m | Radar_Object_Type | Ultrasonic_Distance_cm | GPS_Speed_km/h | Environmental_Conditions | Action_Label |
|---------------------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| 2024-02-15 08:00:00 | Front     | 50               | Car               | 200                    | 30             | Sunny, Dry Road          | Slow Down    |
| 2024-02-15 08:00:01 | Front     | 48               | Car               | 150                    | 0              | Sunny, Dry Road          | Stop         |
| 2024-02-15 08:05:00 | Rear      | 2                | Bicycle           | 50                     | 10             | Cloudy, Wet Road         | Slow Down    |
| 2024-02-15 08:05:01 | Rear      | 1                | Bicycle           | 30                     | 0              | Cloudy, Wet Road         | Stop         |

### Description of Preparation Steps:

1. **Normalization:** Sensor data, like distances and speeds, is normalized to ensure consistency across different scales and units. For example, radar distances might be scaled to a 0-1 range relative to a maximum detection range.

2. **Feature Engineering:** New features are created from the raw data to help the model learn more effectively. This might include:
   - Combining radar and ultrasonic sensor data to provide a comprehensive view of obstacles around the vehicle.
   - Encoding environmental conditions (e.g., "Sunny, Dry Road" as `0`, "Cloudy, Wet Road" as `1`) to facilitate learning from non-numeric data.

3. **Augmentation:** Data might be augmented to improve model robustness. For instance, camera images could be artificially altered to simulate different lighting conditions, helping the model generalize across various environments.

4. **Labeling:** Action labels (e.g., "Slow Down", "Stop") are derived from the scenario or manually annotated, providing a clear target for the model to predict based on the input features.

5. **Integration:** Data from different sensors and sources is combined into a single record for each timestamp, ensuring that each input (row) has a comprehensive set of features reflecting the vehicle's situation at that moment.

This prepared dataset serves as the input for machine learning models, where each row represents a comprehensive snapshot of the vehicle's environment and status, along with the action the vehicle should take. This structured approach allows the model to learn the complex relationships between environmental conditions, sensor readings, and appropriate driving actions.
