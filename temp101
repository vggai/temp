### VD - TV NCD Proposal

#### Existing Solution

- Existing Ad placement solutions like AdWords and similar platforms rely heavily on keyword matching to display ads.
  - When a user searches for these keywords, the ad platform matches the search query with the advertiser's keywords and displays the ads accordingly.
- These platforms use the user's browsing and search history to personalize ad placements.
- They often miss the subtle context within the content being consumed which, if targeted, can help in increasing ad clicks.

#### Proposal

- **Our solution leverages cutting-edge AI to understand and extract context from multimedia content playing on the TV**, offering unparalleled personalization in ad recommendations.
- By automating the process intelligently:
  - We can target the right advertisement to the right user.
  - This reduces the need for manual curation.
  - Saves time and resources.
  - Enhances user engagement and satisfaction.
  - Increases click-through ratios.
